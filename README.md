## Headers

Markdown has headers similar to HTML but use hashes 
instead of the letter "h":

`# header 1`
# header 1
`## header 2`
## header 2
`### header 3`
### header 3
`#### header 4`
#### header 4
`##### header 5`
##### header 5
`###### header 6`
###### header 6

## Font Styles
<br>

### Bold
You can bold stuff by using double asterisks(**).\
Or using double underscore(__).\
`**bold text**` or `__bold text__` will turn to **bold text**

### Italics
You can italicise stuff by using single asterisks(*).\
Or using single underscore(_).\
`*italic text*` or `_italic text_` will turn to *italic text*

### Strikethrough
You can strikethrough stuff by using double tilda(~~).\
`~~strikethrough~~` will turn to ~~strikethrough~~

### Combining all three
It is possible to combine all three together: ~~***combined effort***~~

## Quoting 
By containing things with a single backtick(`) you could quote small 
codes.

For example: \
the start and end of html tags `<h1></h1>`

Or use triple backticks (```) to quote things:


```
This is how you quote large things.
Using triple backticks(`) .
Backtick can be found left of number 1 key.
```
\```<br>
this is how the paragraph was contained<br>
\```

> you could also quote this way

\>this is how you do it, by adding the `>` at the start

Usually the backticks are reserved for codes. But hey, you do you!

## Links

you can link stuff using the `[ ]( )` brackets together

The `[ ]`portion will hold the title you wish to give to the link.

WHile the `( )` portion holds the link itself.

An example:\
`[go to youtube](https://www.youtube.com)`

will look like:\
[go to youtube](https://www.youtube.com)

## Images and GIFs

You can add an additional excalamation mark(!) to links like so:\
`![ ]( )`

Here is an example:

`![random image](images/ctn1.png)`

Will look like:\
![random image](images/ctn1.png)

Or you could also use the HTML `<img>` method.

`<img src="images/ctn1.png" style="height:150px"/>`

Will look like:\
<img src="images/ctn1.png" style="height:150px;"/>

Using HTML `<img>` would allow you to resize your images.

As for GIFs:

`![slime eating](images/slime-eating.gif)`\
![slime eating](images/slime-eating.gif)

`<img src="images/slime-eating.gif" style="height:150px;"/>`\
<img src="images/slime-eating.gif" style="height:150px;"/>
